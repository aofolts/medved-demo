Small Businesses","slug":"static-websites-small-businesses","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"17","month":"May","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"May 17, 2018","tags":["Pingdom","speed

website (like WordPress), a request is made to a database, which returns some data. That data is then used to build an HTML page. Pretty cool!</p><p>The downside is, most small business websites don’t change on an <i>hourly</i> or even <i>daily</i> basis, so the same pages are being “dynamically” built over and over for no reason.</p><h2>What’s a “static” website?</h2><p>In contrast, static sites build every possible page of your website <i>ahead of time</i> and serve them as a package that can be hosted for little to no cost, virtually anywhere.</p><p>They’re faster, more secure, and require less maitenance than dynamics sites, which—for small business owners—means happy users and zero stress.</p><p>Let’s dive into the top five reasons a static site might be the perfect fit for your next project!</p><h3>1. Security</h3><p>Here’s a scary fact: according to WP White Security, “70% of all WordPress installs are <a href=\"https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-news-updates/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/\">vulnerable to hacker attacks</a>.”</p><p>Unlike dynamic websites, static website do not have databases. In other words, they either contain plain HTML files or receive data ahead of time from a seperate, highly-secure source.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Peace of mind. Once set up, a static website can fend for itself, and is essentially impossible to hack.</p><h3>2. Low-Maintenance</h3><p>Traditional content management platforms require constant updates to remain secure, as well as maintenance to ensure these updates don’t break existing functionality.</p><p>Static sites can fetch data from modern “<a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/blog/2018/05/02/how-i-fell-in-love-with-an-api-first-cms/\">API-driven</a>” services (like <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>) that require <i>no maintenance</i> and can be deployed for free.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> No headaches. Your website will work just as well tomorrow as it will five years from now.</p><h3>3. Speed</h3><p>40% of people will leave a site that takes <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/\">longer than three seconds</a> to load.</p><p>That’s a tall order for many dynamic sites—they’re often Frankenstein’ed together with a hideous array of software and hardware that drags down performance.</p><p>Static websites, on the other hand, are highly-optimized, and generally load 10x faster than dynamic sites. Below is a speed test of this page! You can test your site at <a href=\"https://tools.pingdom.com/\">Pingdom</a>.</p>{\"data\":{\"target\":{\"sys\":{\"space\":{\"sys\":{\"type\":\"Link\",\"linkType\":\"Space\",\"id\":\"rupfy7kogibm\"}},\"id\":\"hkvY7EUULYqGuqWWgYOAa\",\"type\":\"Asset\",\"createdAt\":\"2018-12-08T02:48:19.359Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2018-12-08T02:48:19.359Z\",\"environment\":{\"sys\":{\"id\":\"master\",\"type\":\"Link\",\"linkType\":\"Environment\"}},\"revision\":1},\"fields\":{\"title\":{\"en-US\":\"Page Speed Test / Why Static Sites Are a Game-Changer for Small Businesses\"},\"description\":{\"en-US\":\"Page Speed Test / Why Static Sites Are a Game-Changer for Small Businesses\"},\"file\":{\"en-US\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/hkvY7EUULYqGuqWWgYOAa/a9e5e9f967ada345f08730d8263d2709/sherpa-blog-speed-test.jpg\",\"details\":{\"size\":176761,\"image\":{\"width\":1400,\"height\":792}},\"fileName\":\"sherpa-blog-speed-test.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}}}}},\"content\":[],\"nodeType\":\"embedded-asset-block\"}<p></p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Happy users! People are busy—when you respect a potential customer’s time, they’ll be more likely to connect with you, instead of leaving and Googling a competitor.</p><h3>4. Cost-Effective</h3><p>Dynamic websites are complex, which makes them expensive to host and maintain.</p><p>Like I mentioned before, static sites are little more than a package of flat HTML files, which makes hosting much simpler and less expensive.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Cha-ching! Plenty of static hosts (like <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>) and even modern CMS companies offer allow you to deploy a static website for free!</p><h3>5. Flexibility</h3><p>Gone are the days when small businesses had too be tied to one specific platform or technology.</p><p>Static websites are “<a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/headless-and-decoupled-cms/\">headless</a>,” which means you can easily change your front end with minimal edits to the back end (content management)—and vice versa.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Freedom! If you don’t like some aspect of your website, you won’t have to feel like a prisoner to the current setup.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>While static sites won’t fit <i>every</i> use-case (like large blogs or complex e-commerce stores), it’s a really exciting option for most small businesses.</p><p>Feel free to get in touch, and we can assess whether a static website might be a effective option for your next project.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p>—Andrew</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Man working at laptop

But, quite frankly, I think the tools — <i>not</i> the process itself — are at fault.</p><p>When I started freelancing, I was using a combination of Microsoft Word documents, emails, and my brain to keep track of everything, which (spoiler alert) was a nightmare, not a viable project management system.</p><p>I knew project management apps were an option, but the cost (i.e. <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/pricing\">Basecamp</a>) and overall clunkiness (<a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/projects\">Zoho</a>, etc) kept me from using them for a long time.</p><h3>ActiveCollab to the Rescue!</h3><p>I subscribed to <a href=\"https://activecollab.com/\">ActiveCollab</a> in the middle of a large website project that had become too much to manage via email and static notes.</p><p>The company promises a “Powerful, yet simple project management tool,” and that’s exactly what you get.</p><p>The interface is clean and modern, and it was, indeed, so simple to use that I got up-and-running in a matter of minutes.</p><h3>A Few Features I love</h3><p>My favorite thing about ActiveCollab is that the app seems to “anticipate” what I need — whenever I find myself wanting a new feature, the first thing I try often works exactly as I expect.</p><p><b>Multiple Platforms:</b> ActiveCollab can be downloaded for iPhone, accessed in the browser, or installed on your Mac (the desktop app is still a beta version, but performs marvelously).</p><p><b>Sortable Projects:</b> It’s easy to create projects and assign them to a new or existing client.

It took three months of nonstop work. These days I build higher-quality, more complex sites in around 40 hours.</p><p>My secret? I learned to be lazy.</p><p>Now, don’t take that the wrong way. I’m working harder than I ever have, but my productivity as a developer has increased exponentially over time because I implemented a zero-tolerance policy for wastefulness.</p><p>In code speak, everything I do now is as “DRY” as possible.</p><h2>What’s DRY?</h2><p>I built many of my early sites using pre-made WordPress themes — and although they looked great initially, I quickly discovered how much redundant work was required to “hack” them into a format that fit my clients’ specific needs.</p><p>It’s not so bad adding a hundred food menu items until you realize that the layout of these menu items needs to change — and you have to go back and manually edit every… single… one.</p><p>This is both financially and mentally untenable for clients and developers, which is why I follow the DRY mantra…</p><p>aka: “Don’t Repeat Yourself.”</p><h2>A Very DRY Example</h2><p>Custom-coded websites provide excellent opportunities for implementing DRY processes. For example, instead of trying to update 100 menu items, I can create one template that accepts the minimal amount of information from each item (title, price, description).</p><p>In the backend of the website, my clients can simply fill out this info and it gets rendered by the template in a consistent, visually appealing format.</p><p>If my client asks me to alter the appearance of these menu items, I can make the change once in the template — and voila — it will take effect throughout the entire site, everywhere they display.</p><h2>Where DRY and Lazy Meet</h2><p>I think “laziness” gets a bad rap because it’s associated with present-tense laxness — i.e. “I don’t want to do the dishes right now.”</p><p>But to keep moving forward as a developer (or as any professional, really) it’s essential to have a lazy attitude toward the future.</p><p>Take Molly, for example, a fictional kid in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sygqZWBcuKk\">GE’s Inventing commercial</a> who really doesn’t want to take out the trash.</p><p>Once is enough, it turns out. She decides her brainpower can be put to better use and creates a pulley line to handle the job for her… which leads to more inventions and eventually a job at GE.</p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>It’s weird to say, but I think laziness is probably one of the most important drivers of innovation in the world.</p><p>Like Molly, most web developers (and people, in general) don’t want to get stuck doing menial, repetitive tasks.</p><p>We’re all lazy—in the best way possible—and that aversion toward monotony is what motivates us to keep creating brilliant, creative solutions to challenges. Because even the smallest amount of extra effort <i>now</i> can pay off a hundred fold down the road.</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Lazy dog on carpet","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD//gA7Q1JFQVRPUjogZ2QtanBlZyB2MS4wICh1c2luZyBJSkcgSlBFRyB2OTApLCBxdWFsaXR5ID0gODIK/9sAQwAGBAQFBAQGBQUFBgYGBwkOCQkICAkSDQ0KDhUSFhYVEhQUFxohHBcYHxkUFB0nHR8iIyUlJRYcKSwoJCshJCUk/9sAQwEGBgYJCAkRCQkRJBgUGCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQk/8AAEQgADQAUAwEiAAIRAQMRAf/EABcAAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBwX/xAAoEAACAQMDAwIHAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEBREABjESE0EhUQcUIjJhcYH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQP/xAAcEQABBQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDERITIlH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJxQ/Ea6xbZpdq09hSsoo6pqtn6H7juw6enOCAv85863aDY1qq7R36u516XGSWSP5B1Hb7qq+EAb7mPpgAjGVOONSaC5ToxTIODz7nTFt1GuRWaeWTEZLhFYj6h5z41HyY7WJjNLVFE23TUtto5IQIYgzI4QOCVzEmQ3swOQR+NGlCpus5mJPqTySSSf2Tzo1kk4+BfT/9k=","aspectRatio":1.5009380863039399,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=750&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=188&h=125&q=50 188w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=375&h=250&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=750&h=500&q=50 750w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=1125&h=750&q=50 1125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=1500&h=999&q=50 1500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}}},{"node":{"id":"380ebe1c-e74a-555b-8998-b14bef325467","title":"DIY or Hire an Expert: 5 Questions to Help You Decide","slug":"diy-or-hire-expert-questions","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"4","month":"June","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"June 4, 2018","tags":["DIY","expert"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<h2>One Step Forward, One Step Back.</h2><p>Our early ancestors weren’t astronauts or physicists or doctors.

Sure, but I hate doing it, and the definition of a “Marginal Tax Rate” is literally the last thing on earth I want taking up space in my brain.</p><p>My account loves that stuff. I’ll leave it to him.</p><h3>2: Do I know what is required?</h3><p>A few times a year I rotate and/or swap my snow and summer tires. It’s a relatively simple task, and requires only a few tools (jack, tire iron, lubricant).</p><p>On the other hand, I would never try to replace my car’s brakes because I don’t know — even generally — what parts or processes are involved.</p><p>If you can’t outline the basic skills and steps the project requires, then you should go ahead and hire someone who does.</p><h3>3: Is DIY a good use of my time?</h3><p>There’s a common misconception that DIY is somehow “cheap” or even “free.” It’s true, technically you’re not paying someone when you handle a job yourself, but what is your own time worth?</p><p>I could save $25/mo by having clients mail me checks, but <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/\">FreshBooks</a> takes care of this automatically, which frees up multiple hours in my schedule.</p><p>I can use this time to learn new skills, find new clients, or take time off — all of which pay back the original cost manyfold.</p><h3>4: Will the final product be high-quality?</h3><p>Once upon a time (aka two years ago) I tried to code my own project management app. It was a fun and super-rewarding experience, but the task was way too much for one person to handle.</p><p>Nowadays, I <a href=\"http://sherpadesign.co/notebook/activecollab-plan-manage-complex-projects/\">manage complex projects</a> with ActiveCollab, and I’m amazed, on a daily basis, at how much thought and effort must have gone into the app to make it powerful, yet simple and user friendly.</p><p>If you’re starting a DIY project as a beginner, it’s unrealistic to expect professional results.</p><h3>5: Do I know what success and failure look like (specifically)?</h3><p>One of the most challenging parts of learning a new process or skill is trying to figure out whether you’ve done things the right way or made costly mistakes.</p><p>In other words, <i>it’s hard to know what you don’t know</i>.</p><p>Let’s say you create a website on Squarespace. It seems to look ok, so you go ahead and launch. Months go by, and you aren’t getting any traction.</p><p>An expert might review your site and find that your contact form is broken, or your design doesn’t work well on mobile devices, or one of a million such details that they’re trained to be aware of.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>DIY is a great option for casual, low-stakes projects, but can quickly turn into a rabbit hole for more complex undertakings.</p><p>If you answered “no” to more than one of these questions, you should take a step back and consider whether hiring an expert might be the smarter option.</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Stuck in washing machine","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5009380863039399,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=750&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=188&h=125&q=50 188w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=375&h=250&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=750&h=500&q=50 750w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1125&h=750&q=50 1125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1500&h=999&q=50 1500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}}},{"node":{"id":"5d65ea0c-a7ee-54e3-b1ec-baca1fb357a8","title":"What I Learned About Sales From Working at a Running Store","slug":"learned-sales-working-running-store","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"5","month":"September","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"September 5, 2018","tags":["freelance","running store","sales","part-time job"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<p>Three years into my freelance web design career I started working at a local running store to make some extra cash on the side.</p><p><b>But it wasn’t just that.</b> I also needed a break from staring at a computer all day and wanted to meet more people than I normally would as a stay-at-home freelancer (in other words…zero people).</p><p>That said, I didn’t expect to learn much from a job that paid $10/hr when I was earning more than six times that as a web developer.</p><p>I was so wrong.</p><h2>Lesson 1: Ask and You Shall Receive</h2><p>Frequently, customers will come into a running store and say something like, “<i>My knees hurt. I need a shoe with a lot of </i><i><b>cushion</b></i><i>!</i>”</p><p>A less-experienced me might answer “ok, I’ll grab a few <b>high-cushion</b> shoes…what size do you usually wear?” But this isn’t enough information to base a solid recommendation on.</p><p>In fact, within a few weeks of being hired I started to learn that the more questions I asked the happier my customers were with the shoes I brought out for them (and the more likely they were to buy them).</p><p>For example: Asking, “How long have you been wearing those?” often reveals that a customer has simply been running too long in the same shoes, and they don’t need more cushion—just a fresh pair!</p><h2>Lesson 2: Consider Everything, Trust Nothing</h2><p>People are notoriously unreliable witnesses, even (sometimes especially) when it comes to understanding or articulating their own needs.</p><p>I once worked with a guy who insisted he was a <b>size 9.5 wide</b>. In fact, not only did he measure as a 11 normal width, but the shoes he wore into the store were clearly marked with the larger size.</p><p>Whether you’re selling $120 sneakers or a $5,000 website, listening is an important skill, but you should <b>always verify</b> what your customers state as “fact.”</p><p>If you don’t catch misinformation early you can complete a whole project on inaccurate specs…and guess who’s going to get the blame?</p><p>*Hint: not the customer!</p><h2>Lesson 3: Sell Before You Sell</h2><p>The running store I work at has been around for more than 30 years.

Personally, I still don’t 100% enjoy it—I’d rather be designing or writing code. BUT… selling shoes for hours at a time on a weekly basis has taught me that it can be much more rewarding if I simply incorporate a <b>clear sales process</b>.</p><p>My process for selling shoes looks something like this—notice how a few simple questions can narrow 500 shoes down to 20, making the task more manageable (and increasing the probability of success):</p><ol><li><p>Customer walks in and says they want new shoes: <b>500 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>I ask if they want the same thing or to start fresh: <b>Something similar</b></p></li><li><p>I ask what they would change about the shoe: <b>Too wide</b></p></li><li><p>We measure, and their current shoes ARE too wide: <b>20 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>I bring out three options.

More testing: <b>3 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>They eliminate shoe 1, then test 2 and 3 some more: <b>2 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>Shoe 3 wins!</p></li></ol><p>Your process should feel like an <b>“</b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_%28computer_programming%29\"><b>if/else” tree</b></a>. You start with a blank slate, not knowing what your prospective client wants or needs. Then, you ask a series of questions that narrow the possibilities down—a “<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/296526\">sales funnel</a>.”</p><p>Each intersection should be planned, like a railroad switch, and you should know what to do or which questions to ask next based on the answer your client gives. This eliminates the fear of uncertainty and makes you more confident in your recommendations!</p><h2>Lesson 5: Control the Sale</h2><p>As a freelancer, it can be very easy for a sale (or any project) to <b>“get away from you”</b> when you’re working with an inexperienced or impulsive client.</p><p>Similarly, I often have people come into my local running store who just start pulling random shoes off the wall: “I want this, and this, and that too!”</p><p>I saved this lesson for last because it’s the most important:</p><p><b>NEVER EVER</b> let your client hijack your sales process.</p><p>If you recognize this happening you need to bring things to a dead stop and restart from wherever you left off in your process. For example, to an unruly shoe customer, I’ll often say something like:</p><blockquote><p>“Ok, but before I grab those for you, let’s just double-check your shoe size. I’d also like to get you on the treadmill briefly so we can take a look at your gait and make sure we’re in the right range of shoes.”</p></blockquote><p>When I was starting out (both as a freelancer and a shoe salesman) I didn’t understand why things always seemed to <b>spiral out of control</b>—or why I didn’t seem to be getting any better at sales.</p><p>Was I just approaching/attracting bad clients?</p><p>That was occasionally true, but mostly I sucked at sales because I didn’t have a consistent process. I was either molding my process to each specific client or letting my clients dictate my process to me.</p><p>This is a recipe for disaster, and worse, if you do things differently every time you don’t have a formula to improve upon—and you’ll just keep running into the same problems over and over.</p><h2>Recapping What I Learned</h2><p>I think the biggest mistake freelancers (myself included) make is <b>neglecting or avoiding sales</b>, instead of just treating it like their normal work.</p><p>While I doubt the word “sales” will ever get me out of bed in the morning, simply having a solid approach makes me hate it a little less every day.</p><p>When you know what questions to ask and have a set-in-stone outline of where your sale is headed it <b>takes the pressure off you</b> as an individual and filters clients through your requirements—not the other way around.</p><p><i>p.s. Clients will respect you more for this!</i></p><p>I’d recommend getting a part-time job in sales for any freelancer, whether you’re just starting out or looking to switch things up.</p><p>Happy Freelancing!</p><p>—Andrew</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"People shoes circle","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/3dK11Na3Cw4A8a4SgmmagY/272b272d68354ee3fab77f5fb198413d/people-shoes-circle.jpg?w=750&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/3dK11Na3Cw4A8a4SgmmagY/272b272d68354ee3fab77f5fb198413d/people-shoes-circle.jpg?w=188&h=141&q=50 188w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/3dK11Na3Cw4A8a4SgmmagY/272b272d68354ee3fab77f5fb198413d/people-shoes-circle.jpg?w=375&h=281&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/3dK11Na3Cw4A8a4SgmmagY/272b272d68354ee3fab77f5fb198413d/people-shoes-circle.jpg?w=750&h=563&q=50 750w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/3dK11Na3Cw4A8a4SgmmagY/272b272d68354ee3fab77f5fb198413d/people-shoes-circle.jpg?w=1125&h=844&q=50 1125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/3dK11Na3Cw4A8a4SgmmagY/272b272d68354ee3fab77f5fb198413d/people-shoes-circle.jpg?w=1500&h=1125&q=50 1500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/3dK11Na3Cw4A8a4SgmmagY/272b272d68354ee3fab77f5fb198413d/people-shoes-circle.jpg?w=1600&h=1200&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}}},{"node":{"id":"63b98bf7-1016-5b6d-b83e-0372cdf08932","title":"5 Stages of Being a WordPress Developer (#4 is Moving On)","slug":"stages-being-wordpress-developer","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"6","month":"June","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"June 6, 2018","tags":["WordPress","web developer","static websites"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<h2>Part 1: How I Discovered WordPress</h2><p>I “built” my first WordPress website in the summer of 2014—like a lot of newbie developers I didn’t have much skill with coding, so I started out with a <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/item/lemonchili-a-restaurant-wordpress-theme/4565068\">pre-made theme</a> and proceeded to hack it into a semi-serviceable state.</p><p><i>This is brilliant</i>, I thought.</p><p>For $40, you could buy a website, and (like magic) just add content. When my clients needed new features, I could simply install a plugin. Easy.</p><h3>Not so fast, sparky…</h3><p>As it turns out, this was a _massive _over-simplification of what it took to create an effective website. After using pre-made themes for my first four or five projects, the limitations began to become <i>painfully clear</i>.</p><p>I was spending the vast majority of my time contacting support and doggedly searching StackOverflow, rather than actually building or designing.</p><p>Too often, when my clients requested a certain layout change or feature addition, I had to either tell them that it couldn’t be done or add YET ANOTHER plugin, making their sites more and more unstable.</p><h3>Copy-and-paste hell</h3><p>Worse, most themes offered no way to reuse content. And while copy-and-pasting worked well initially, it became a nightmare when content changes meant editing 50 different theme options to change one color.</p><p>I didn’t know it at the time, but I was treading all over the principal rule of web development: DRY, aka “Don’t Repeat Yourself.”</p><p>Even though I generally _liked _WordPress, this wasn’t sustainable.</p><h2>Part 2: Coding Custom Themes</h2><p><i>Ahh</i>, I thought. <i>I know what the problem is…I just need to make MY OWN themes from scratch, instead of using pre-made templates.</i></p><p>By this point, I had already left a full-time job as a copywriter to start my own web design business, so I had an abundance of free time on my hands—it was the perfect time to learn how to code.</p><h3>My first WordPress theme</h3><p>After spending two months getting the basics down, I took on my first <i>truly custom</i> website project. Not surprisingly, it was MUCH more difficult than I expected, and I was <b>up for 36+ hours the night before launch</b>, tearing my hair out over a seemingly endless list of problems.</p><p>BUT…despite the extra work, coding websites was definitely more rewarding than hacking pre-made themes—it produced a higher-quality end product that I was actually <i>proud</i> of. Things were looking up.</p><h3>“Don’t Repeat Yourself” revisited</h3><p>While I was much more able to implement a DRY workflow coding websites from scratch, I was still repeating myself from <i>project-to-project</i>.</p><p>In mid 2015, I started writing a plugin, “WP Blueprint,” to normalize WordPress and make certain tasks easier—creating common fields, implementing a blog, adding a mobile menu, etc.</p><p>It wasn’t easy, but I eventually got to a point where I could build WordPress themes relatively quickly with less initial hassle.</p><p>Still, there was another problem looming…</p><h2>Part 3: Swamped By Maintenance</h2><p>Hosting and maintenance were sticking points for many of my clients. They were frustrated by having to pay a monthly fee <i>on top of</i> the sizable investment they had already made.</p><p>And while I was finally enjoying the process of building websites, I also hated being tied down by longterm maintenance—it was preventing me from getting a sense of satisfaction from finishing projects.</p><h3>Where there’s a fee, there’s a way…or not</h3><p>At first, I charged $10/mo, then $20, then $35, and finally $75 in an attempt to make maintaining WordPress sites _worth it _for me.</p><p>The trouble is, WordPress sites need to receive frequent updates, and a single line of bad or incompatible code can take your entire site down—or worse, leave it vulnerable to hackers (who can smell <i>insecure WordPress sites</i> like <i>sharks can smell blood in the water</i>).</p><p>Not to mention, all this stress felt like a ridiculous waste of my time and of my clients’ money. Something had to change.</p><h2>Part 4: Taking My Sanity Back</h2><p>I’ve been hearing the term “<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/denji/7205625\">static site generator</a>” for years, but it was my frustration with WordPress that finally caused me to investigate deeper.</p><p>Simply put…</p><blockquote><p>A static site generator (SSG) is a tool that takes some raw data (say, a bunch of text files or a JSON response from an API) and compiles that data into a nice, neat package that can be served anywhere.</p></blockquote><p>Given the lower cost, better performance, and easier development process, I was intrigued—and after knocking out a simple project in <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby.js</a> (one of many SSGs available), I was 100% sold.</p><p>I’ve since built one app and three more static websites.</p><h3>Goodbye PHP. Hello Node.js!</h3><p>PHP will always have a special place in my heart—it’s a great language, and it’s also how (via WordPress) I first learned a lot of core coding concepts, like object-oriented programming and inheritance.</p><p>But it’s also stale, over-stuffed with antiquated, inconsistent features, and incapable of handling real-time user interaction.</p><p>With Node.js (and Javascript), I no longer have to worry about separating my code into two languages, and the clear dominance of Javascript over PHP offers a wider horizon of future possibilities.</p><h3>What maintenance?</h3><p>Like I mentioned earlier, WordPress sites are <i>notoriously difficult to maintain</i>. Static sites, on the other hand, require little to no maintenance, and (barring feature additions or redesigns) can be left to their own devices for years.</p><p>Because content for static sites is either stored as raw files or requested from a highly secure content management system (CMS), like <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a> or <a href=\"https://prismic.io/\">Prismic</a>, the chances of getting hacked are <i>significantly</i> lower than they would be for your average WordPress install.</p><p>Netlify won’t deploy a build with errors. #PeaceOfMind ✌️</p><p>Plus, when clients do make content changes, a static site host, like <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>, will attempt to rebuild your app. If there are errors, the changes will <i>not</i> go live—as opposed to WordPress errors, which can instantly take down your whole site.</p><p>This is an <i>absolute godsend</i> for busy developers and non-tech-savvy clients.</p><h2>Part 5: Will I Ever Go Back to WordPress?</h2><p>Probably not… 😢 While WordPress may appeal to entry-level audiences for years to come, I see nothing on the horizon that will make the platform attractive to developers.</p><h3>Gutenberg won’t save WordPress</h3><p>As of version 5.0, WordPress will be switching over to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>—its shiny new visual editor—in an attempt to fend off competition from website builder platforms like Wix and Squarespace.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I think Gutenberg is a potentially great addition for users on a limited budget, but for developers…</p><blockquote><p>…it works about as well as a mechanic handing their customer a toolbox and saying, “Have at it, hoss!”</p></blockquote><p>A much better solution is for developers to provide users with explicit inputs for their information and content—which can then be used to deliver a high-quality, well-thought-out front-end.</p><h3>Problems run deep</h3><p>WordPress has been a hot mess for years — the tens of thousands of plugins in existence are less a testament to the flexibility of WordPress than they are an attempt to relentlessly shoehorn a <b>blogging platform</b> into roles it was never intended or built to fill.</p><p>Even if the REST API was production-ready (which it’s really not), it’s mostly pointless, because the vast majority of plugins that make WordPress a desirable solution don’t work with headless, API-driven apps.</p><p>At the end of the day, WordPress is stuck in the past, and while the sheer number of existing sites will keep it alive for years to come, its relevance to modern web development will decrease on a daily basis.</p><p>So, with al that said…</p><p>Farewell, WordPress; I’m off to greener pastures.</p><p><Happy coding!/></p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Big foot toy
