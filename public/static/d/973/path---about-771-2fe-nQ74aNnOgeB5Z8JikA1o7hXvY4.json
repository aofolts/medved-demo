Nice to meet you.</h2><p>I am a Rochester, NY-based digital strategist, designer, and developer who helps small businesses build Hard-Working Websites™.</p><p>Sherpa Design Co. is a company I founded to solve a big problem: <i>the lazy website</i>. </p><p>We've all been there—endless \"plugin\" updates, clunky interfaces, inconsistent visual styles, and (worst of all) sub-par business results.</p><p>If you're tired of cookie cutter solutions, and you know you DIY won't work, I'm here to guide you through the entire process—from research and strategy to design to coding.</p><h3>Helping small businesses grow tall</h3><p>Since 2014, I've worked with over 35 businesses to build impactful brands and websites.</p><p>In that time, I've been fortunate enough to develop longterm relationships with some super-passionate, creative companies.</p><p>Just to name a few... </p><ul><li><p>Joe Squared: Slug undefined: a Baltimore restaurant, featured on Diners Drive-Ins, and Dives.</p></li><li><p>Learning Everywhere: Slug undefined: a team of educators who train leaders all around the world.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://www.connectingtothecore.org\"><b>Connecting to the Core</b></a>: a life coach, mediation, and market research consultancy.</p></li></ul><p>Call me crazy, but 10,000+ hours of writing, coding, designing, and strategizing has changed me from a mere freelancer into a true <i>digital sherpa</i>—and I'm prepared to put my experience to work for your brand.</p><h3>The lowdown on my background</h3><p>After graduating from the <a href=\"http://newhouse.syr.edu\">Newhouse School</a> at Syracuse University with a degree in creative advertising, I took a job as a copywriter in New Jersey, and cut my teeth working with name brands like MasterCard and Johnson & Johnson.</p><blockquote><p>True story: I carried my bike up three flights of stairs every day for a year (and I'm ready to apply the same crazy work ethic to your project!</p></blockquote><p>In fall of 2015, I left my copywriting job to build websites full time. It was much harder than I ever imagined, but, more than just a freelancer, I wanted to be an advisor and problem-solver for small businesses.</p><p>That meant teaching myself to code. To design. To conduct in-depth research. To manage complicated projects.</p><p>But, most importantly, it meant understanding the <i>business</i> of design, so I could help clients go from A-Z — instead of getting stuck with a piece of the puzzle or a half-baked solution.</p><h3>I'm a human, too!</h3><p>I'll be the first to admit, I spend a ton of time solving business problems. Like Michael Scott says in The Office, <i>\"I work too hard, I care too much, and sometimes I can be too invested in my job.\"</i></p><p>But when I'm not designing or coding, I love getting outdoors to run, backpack, or catch some live music. </p><p>I’ve been a drummer since the third grade, and you can occasionally find me helping out at my local running store in Rochester.</p><h3>Enough on me. Let’s hear about you!</h3><p>I love meeting creative people who are passionate about their work.
