They were generalists — completely overwhelmed by the numerous skills required to simply stay alive.</p><p>Millions of years years later DIY is fashionable again thanks to the internet, which makes it possible to “become a marketing expert in one day” or “build a better website in an hour” or “buy 10,000 Twitter followers for $40.”</p><p>This all sounds great, but is DIY really an effective strategy for your business?</p><p><i>Is it even worth your time?</i></p><h2>Spoiler Alert: Probably not.</h2><p>If you’re considering handling your next project yourself, it can be helpful to ask yourself a these 5 questions before diving in:</p><h3>1: Am I going to enjoy this?</h3><p>I think passion begets results, and vice versa, so before you embark on a DIY journey you should always ask yourself whether this is a skill you even _want _to develop.</p><p>Am I capable of doing my own taxes? Sure, but I hate doing it, and the definition of a “Marginal Tax Rate” is literally the last thing on earth I want taking up space in my brain.</p><p>My account loves that stuff. I’ll leave it to him.</p><h3>2: Do I know what is required?</h3><p>A few times a year I rotate and/or swap my snow and summer tires. It’s a relatively simple task, and requires only a few tools (jack, tire iron, lubricant).</p><p>On the other hand, I would never try to replace my car’s brakes because I don’t know — even generally — what parts or processes are involved.</p><p>If you can’t outline the basic skills and steps the project requires, then you should go ahead and hire someone who does.</p><h3>3: Is DIY a good use of my time?</h3><p>There’s a common misconception that DIY is somehow “cheap” or even “free.” It’s true, technically you’re not paying someone when you handle a job yourself, but what is your own time worth?</p><p>I could save $25/mo by having clients mail me checks, but <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/\">FreshBooks</a> takes care of this automatically, which frees up multiple hours in my schedule.</p><p>I can use this time to learn new skills, find new clients, or take time off — all of which pay back the original cost manyfold.</p><h3>4: Will the final product be high-quality?</h3><p>Once upon a time (aka two years ago) I tried to code my own project management app. It was a fun and super-rewarding experience, but the task was way too much for one person to handle.</p><p>Nowadays, I <a href=\"http://sherpadesign.co/notebook/activecollab-plan-manage-complex-projects/\">manage complex projects</a> with ActiveCollab, and I’m amazed, on a daily basis, at how much thought and effort must have gone into the app to make it powerful, yet simple and user friendly.</p><p>If you’re starting a DIY project as a beginner, it’s unrealistic to expect professional results.</p><h3>5: Do I know what success and failure look like (specifically)?</h3><p>One of the most challenging parts of learning a new process or skill is trying to figure out whether you’ve done things the right way or made costly mistakes.</p><p>In other words, <i>it’s hard to know what you don’t know</i>.</p><p>Let’s say you create a website on Squarespace. It seems to look ok, so you go ahead and launch. Months go by, and you aren’t getting any traction.</p><p>An expert might review your site and find that your contact form is broken, or your design doesn’t work well on mobile devices, or one of a million such details that they’re trained to be aware of.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>DIY is a great option for casual, low-stakes projects, but can quickly turn into a rabbit hole for more complex undertakings.</p><p>If you answered “no” to more than one of these questions, you should take a step back and consider whether hiring an expert might be the smarter option.</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Stuck in washing machine","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5009380863039399,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1920&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=480&h=320&q=50 480w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=960&h=640&q=50 960w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"diy-or-hire-expert-questions"}}
