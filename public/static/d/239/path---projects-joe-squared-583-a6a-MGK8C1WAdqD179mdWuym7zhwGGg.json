I hopped on board to help update the company's brand identity and rebuild their existing website..</p><h3>The Challenge</h3><p>More than good food and drinks, Joe Squared is about bringing people together and giving back to the local Station North community.</p><p>Actions speak louder than words, but even though Joe Squared was well-known to locals, the current website wasn't working hard enough to attract new customers.</p><h2>The Solution</h2><p>There are plenty of restaurants that serve tasty food in Baltimore, but community is the one ingredient that really makes Joe Squared special.</p><p>I tag-teamed with co-owner Kathy \"Mamma Joe\" Palokoff to develop a website concept centered around the idea of, \"Pizza that does good.™\"</p><h3>A fiery new identity.</h3><p>Joe Squared is famous for its, well… <i>square</i> pizzas—but also for its blazing-hot, coal-fired oven, which cooks at around 900 degrees. A spicy red set against dark type captures that heat rather nicely! The Edmondsans font family lends a friendly personality to the whole site.</p><h3>Menu browsing, easy peasy.</h3><p>With more than a hundred items on the menu, static PDFs were making it too difficult for people to peruse their options—especially for users on smart phones.</p><p>I created a whole new menu system on a more modern CMS, <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com\">Contentful</a>, which made it super-easy for the team to add and edit menu items. I also implemented some handy sorting features, that allowed people to quickly jump between different categories and ingredients.</p><h3>Static, at the speed of light.</h3><p>While the previous site had run on WordPress for years, the constant updates, plugin issues, and outdated interfaces were becoming a huge pain.</p><p>In addition to migrating content to Contentful, I also rewrote Joe Squared as a \"<a href='https://www.sherpadesign.co/journal/static-websites-small-businesses'>static website</a>,\" which essentially means that it now loads 10x faster (in under half a second) and doesn't require any regular maintenance.</p><h3>Fresh (content) out of the oven.</h3><p>With a shiny new CMS, the team was able to keep the site fresh with local art shows, \"Do Good Pizza\" announcements, and upcoming comedy/music events.</p><p>I integrated Eventbrite to automate the event posting process—once being published they show up seamlessly on the restaurant's website and Facebook page. This saves a heck of a lot of time (and frustration) from double-posting every event!</p><h2>The Results</h2><p>In the first week, alone, we saw <a href=\"https://www.joesquared.com\">joesquared.com</a>'s bounce rate drop by 23% and its session time increase from under a minute to almost three. In case you were wondering, that's tech-speak for people spending longer on the site and visiting more pages!</p><p>More importantly, Joe Squared now has a clearer stance—the website lets visitors know the brand is all about community, and makes it easy for them to plan a visit or learn more.</p><p>Bon Appétit! </p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Joe Squared Pizza Project Hero","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5r0rYM77WM6IMiEkauy4wy/694c176e26637478ebeddf67c007a57e/April_Special_Pizzas.jpeg?w=1920&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5r0rYM77WM6IMiEkauy4wy/694c176e26637478ebeddf67c007a57e/April_Special_Pizzas.jpeg?w=480&h=360&q=50 480w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5r0rYM77WM6IMiEkauy4wy/694c176e26637478ebeddf67c007a57e/April_Special_Pizzas.jpeg?w=960&h=720&q=50 960w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5r0rYM77WM6IMiEkauy4wy/694c176e26637478ebeddf67c007a57e/April_Special_Pizzas.jpeg?w=1600&h=1200&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"joe-squared"}}
