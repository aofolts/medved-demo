Project management is the ugly duckling of freelance.</h2><p>It can be extremely difficult, time-consuming, and boring. But, quite frankly, I think the tools — <i>not</i> the process itself — are at fault.</p><p>When I started freelancing, I was using a combination of Microsoft Word documents, emails, and my brain to keep track of everything, which (spoiler alert) was a nightmare, not a viable project management system.</p><p>I knew project management apps were an option, but the cost (i.e. <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/pricing\">Basecamp</a>) and overall clunkiness (<a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/projects\">Zoho</a>, etc) kept me from using them for a long time.</p><h3>ActiveCollab to the Rescue!</h3><p>I subscribed to <a href=\"https://activecollab.com/\">ActiveCollab</a> in the middle of a large website project that had become too much to manage via email and static notes.</p><p>The company promises a “Powerful, yet simple project management tool,” and that’s exactly what you get.</p><p>The interface is clean and modern, and it was, indeed, so simple to use that I got up-and-running in a matter of minutes.</p><h3>A Few Features I love</h3><p>My favorite thing about ActiveCollab is that the app seems to “anticipate” what I need — whenever I find myself wanting a new feature, the first thing I try often works exactly as I expect.</p><p><b>Multiple Platforms:</b> ActiveCollab can be downloaded for iPhone, accessed in the browser, or installed on your Mac (the desktop app is still a beta version, but performs marvelously).</p><p><b>Sortable Projects:</b> It’s easy to create projects and assign them to a new or existing client. The various filters (client, category, etc) give me a quick bird’s eye view of everything I’m working on.</p><p><b>Tasks and Lists:</b> Lists within a given project keep things organized, and you can add helpful details to individual tasks (like due dates, file attachments, and assigned team members).</p><p><b>Pricing:</b> $25/mo is very reasonable!</p><h3>My Process For Building Websites</h3><ol><li><p><b>Preparation:</b> My first step is always to conduct an in-depth information gathering session with my client to discuss their primary challenges, and then define an effective solution.</p></li><li><p><b>Setup:</b> Next, I create a new ActiveCollab project from a pre-existing template to map out some high-level milestones, such as “Home Page Mockup Review,” “Testing,” and “Website Launch.”</p></li><li><p><b>Notes:</b> Whenever I have a call or receive input from a client, I take notes directly in ActiveCollab and parse out todo items into individual tasks, which ensures we don’t lose track of anything we discussed.</p></li><li><p><b>Accountability:</b> I assign all tasks to a team member, add due dates, and attach files, so everything can be managed from one location… no more scouring my inbox for elusive emails!</p></li><li><p><b>Debrief:</b> Once a project is finished, I check back on a task list called “Project Debrief,” which I use along the way to capture any mistakes or ideas for future improvement.</p></li><li><p><b>Implementation:</b> These get moved into specific templates or projects under my own company page (so I remember to implement them in my next project).</p></li></ol><p></p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Journal / Managing Complex Projects with ActiveCollab","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.78173719376392,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=1920&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=480&h=269&q=50 480w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=960&h=539&q=50 960w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=1600&h=898&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"activecollab-manage-complex-projects"}}
