2018","audience":"Everyone","category":"Productivity","tags":["productivity","Notion","apps"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<h2>Feel like an octopus? It's not just you.</h2><p>Whether you're freelancing, running a business, or just trying to train for a 5k, you've probably turned to productivity apps at some point:</p><p>Evernote (for quick ideas), DropBox (for file sharing), Google Docs (for collaborative writing), Trello (for project management), LinkedIn (for networking)...the list goes on.</p><p>I'm guilty of using too many apps. We all are. But up until a few days I didn't know there was a better option. One app can't do everything, can it?</p><h2>Enter Notion</h2><p>I first heard about Notion on the <a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntaxt</a> podcast (shoutout to Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski). And while I had no clue what it even was, the name sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out.</p><p>Notion's <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">landing page</a> is super-minimal. In fact, it's so minimal that I <i>almost</i> clicked away—here we go again with another half-assed \"one-in-all\" productivity app, I thought.</p><img class='contentful-embedded-asset' src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/2jkPsj78SQ2iuE8G0eKoAw/ed7619eadd4957fbad0a38a2a11765b2/giphy__1_.gif\"/><p></p><p>But thank god I scrolled, because further down the page was a live, fully-interactive demo of Notion's app. (Seriously, how ballsy is it to let people loose on an app with zero context? You really have to believe in your product).</p><p>After playing around for about thirty seconds, it became clear to me that Notion was not just another do-it-all app. I happily signed up for a free account.</p><h2>Hour one with Notion</h2><p>I really can't think of an app I've fallen in love with faster than Notion. It does so many things so well that's it's actually hard to describe. But let me put it this way...</p><blockquote><p>Imagine if The New Yorker, BaseCamp, and Evernote had a lovechild.</p></blockquote><p>My first foray into Notion's app was porting over all the content I was working on—I created a page called \"Blog Posts,\" then proceeded to add sub-pages for each post, which I realized was as easy as typing \"/\".</p><p>I also set up some pages for groceries, random ideas, back burner tasks, and daily todo items (more on that in a bit).</p><h3>Sub Pages</h3><p>Notion automatically stores sub-pages in a folder-like structure under the parent page. Pretty cool, huh? Well, keep reading, my friend, because that's just one of about ten million things Notion just does \"automatically.\"</p><h2>Day one with Notion</h2><h3>Slash Command</h3><p>Slash commands really are a thing of beauty in Notion. You can use them to create pages, headings, inline images, references, and a whole lot more—the writing experience is just as fluid as <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a> and ten times more powerful.</p><p>One \"Block\" I took advantage of almost immediately is the \"To-do List.\" While Notion isn't a replacement for a full-on project management app, a basic checkbox list covers 99% of my personal and solo business use-cases.</p><h3>Mention</h3><p>You can Mention pages in Notion by typing \"@\", which creates a link to that content. Like Wikipedia, this allows you to jump between related assets much more quickly than rooting through your filesystem over and over.</p><p>If you really want to get fancy, you can Mention a date inside a To-do item, which sends an email message and mobile alert at the specified time so you don't forget to complete the task. Notion is even smart enough to covert \"@Next Tuesday\" into a real date.</p><h3>Custom Databases</h3><p>I was already sold on Notion after the first few minutes, but the feature that really sealed the deal for me was the Database page.</p><p>At first, I thought \"Database\" just meant a data table, so I ignored it.</p><p>However, after loading 10+ articles under my \"Blog Posts\" page, I realized sub-pages weren't a sustainable way to organize lots of content. I took a closer look at the Database feature, and was completely blown away.</p><p>While Notion Databases <i>look</i> like regular tables, they're much more flexible under the hood. You can add custom properties, filters, and views—and each row opens (yup, you guessed it) a fully-editable Notion page.</p><h2>Week one with Notion</h2><p>Before stumbling across Notion, I repeatedly tried (and failed) to devise an organizational system to store all the information I need to access on a regular basis.</p><p>I used it all: project management apps, note taking apps, physical journals, note cards...I even made a go of it on my website's CMS, <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>. Nothing fit the bill. That's why I'm so excited about Notion—it truly is a all-in-one solution.</p><h3>People and Projects</h3><p>I mentioned earlier (no pun intended) about how useful Mentions are for linking content, and one of the best use cases I've discovered is interconnecting common data between my Contacts and Projects.</p><p>For example, in the Projects database, each project has a property called \"Primary Contact.\" In this, I link to a person in my Contacts database. That gives me quick access to the person's info—and if anything changes, I don't have to manually update stuff in fifty different places, because there's only one \"source of truth.\"</p><p>Custom properties also give me the power to filter my databases and set up different \"Views.\" For example, I have Views for different types of Contacts based on their \"Relation\" to me: \"Contractor,\" \"Client,\" \"Lead,\" etc.</p><p><i>Nerdy footnote: I originally set my \"Primary Contact\" property to accept text. In each row, I was Mentioning (linking to) a certain Contact. I then realized Notion supports \"Relation\" properties that are meant for this—when I made the switch Notion magically converted all my inline Mention links into regular Relation links. Sweet!</i></p><h3>Recurring Tasks</h3><p>I'll be honest, I'm pretty disorganized by nature. Even simple daily tasks like fixing meals and working out tend to fall by the wayside when I get busy and/or distracted.</p><p>With Notion, my personal and business tasks are now in one place.</p><p>I have to-do pages for today's tasks, daily tasks, and weekly tasks, as well as a planning page for my longterm goals. By simply checking Notion a few times a day, I can easily see what needs doing, and my productivity has shot way up, as a result.</p><h3>Process, Resources, Inspiration</h3><p>Like I said before, Notion is sort of like your own personal Wikipedia. I took that idea and ran with it during my first week, creating three more databases: Process (for documentation), Resources (for books, podcasts, videos, etc), and Inspiration (for design samples).</p><p>While I'm currently a one-man shop, I'll inevitably be adding more people to my team, and that means cultivating a high-quality knowledge base of processes and best practices. Whenever I add a new Process to the database, I Mention (link to) other Processes wherever possible, which creates a richer, more deeply-connected collection of content.</p><p>Resources works more as a database of external information that I can enter once and search for later—by Title, Author, or even Keywords. Inspiration is similar, except I use a \"Board View\" to paw through designs, photos, and websites when I'm trying to brainstorm ideas for a new project.</p><h2>TL;DR:  Four reasons to start using Notion today</h2><p>I've been using Notion for less that a week, and I'm already seeing huge benefits. If you haven't given it a try yet, here are my top favorite features (aka why you should go give it a try right now).</p><ol><li><p><b>One source of truth</b>: Notion won't replace <i>every</i> app you use, but it might kill off 3-5.</p></li><li><p><b>Flexibility:</b> You can define a digital workspace that makes sense to you.</p></li><li><p><b>Linking: </b>Bounce between related content ten

2018","audience":"Freelancers","category":"Project Management","tags":["project management","pro bono","freelance"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<h2>Before we begin...</h2><p>I'm not sharing this story to gripe. I'm sharing it because making mistakes (even disastrous one) is the best way to improve as a freelancer—and, if you're lucky, you can learn from <i>other</i> people's mistakes, so you don't have to waste time learning the hard way.</p><p>So, with that said, buckle in. It's going to be a bumpy ride.</p><p><i><b>Disclaimer:</b></i><i> one freelancer was harmed in the writing of this blog post.</i></p><h3>Let me tell you a horror story.</h3><p>No, I'm not talking about Freddy Kruger, Norman Bates, or Michael Myers. It's something eeeeeeven more terrifying...</p><p>A project with no project management. <i>(Cue blood-curdling scream.)</i></p><p>It was the summer of 2017, and two years after starting a freelance business career my portfolio was growing steadily. There had been plenty of rough patches—my process was inconsistent, but I felt like I had the skills to knock my next project out of the park.</p><h3>No money, no problem.</h3><p>That week I got connected with a client who wanted a pro-bono website in exchange for referrals. Her organization was full of potential contacts, and it seemed like a great way to get my name out there, so I agreed to do the job.</p><p>Agreed to what, you say? Good question. If only I had asked it.</p><p>Instead, not knowing exactly how to assign a value to \"referrals,\" I put off discussing the specific terms of the engagement until it fell completely off my radar. I was doing the work for free, and I figured that meant it would be ok to play everything by ear.</p><p><i><b>Lesson #1, Talk Money:</b></i><i> Never assume free work will be valued by a client. In fact, assume the opposite. If you don't talk about money and value from the get-go, it will take all of about five seconds for your role to change from expert to pixel-pusher.</i></p><h3>All sunshine and rainbows. At first.</h3><p>The project started well. Everyone was on the same page, and we were feeling the shared excitement of envisioning all the possibilities for the new website—story submissions, blog posts, video content, custom forms...</p><p>It didn't take long, though, for things to begin falling apart at the seams.</p><p>While we made it through the prototyping phase, the writer who was supposed to deliver the content got tied up with other (read: higher-priority) work and ended up delivering more than a month late, in which time I became the focal point of my client's growing frustration and impatience.</p><p>As we moved into development and watched our original January 1st deadline sail past, the number and specificity of revisions increased exponentially. The relationship had gradually devolved from a place of trust and respect to a near-battle royale, with paranoia and micromanagement in one corner (my client) and exhaustion and resentment (me) in the other.</p><p><i><b>Lesson #2, Get Serious:</b></i><i> Right after the money discussion, you need to have a time discussion. That means clearly mapping out the project scope, assigning roles, and agreeing on important milestones. Better yet, implement a contract with penalties for delays or late deliverables, so everyone knows this is a serious commitment.</i></p><h3>Maintenance: the final straw</h3><p>By that summer, I had finally ironed out 95% percent of my clients' requests, and it was time to decide how the new website was going to be managed.</p><p>While I had started the project feeling like it would be no big deal to host and maintain the site for free (in return for continued referrals) I knew the level of changes my client would inevitably request necessitated a bigger fee. I quoted $75/mo (which, in truth, was still not enough), but my client only became more angry.</p><p>How can I go from $0/year to $900/year???</p><p>That was more than reasonable, I claimed, given the fact that we had developed a custom WordPress theme to support all the custom features we had agreed on—plus regular updates and future customizations.</p><p><i><b>Lesson #3, No Surprises:</b></i><i> Assume your clients know nothing about what you do. When scope creep sets in, you need to identify it and explain what those additions will cost, so your client doesn't get broadsided at the end of the project.</i></p><h3>The sum of all my mistakes</h3><p>If you've read this far, you're probably thinking: \"It can't get any worse!\" Sorry, friend, but the the worst is yet to come.</p><p>Despite all the malcontent, my client did acknowledge (at least in part) how much free work had gone into the project thus far, so she invited me to set up a station at the event to present the website and—hopefully—make some connections. I felt obliged to try and salvage SOMETHING from the project, so I agreed to come.</p><p>But with the maintenance question unresolved and the website not yet finished, I felt like I was walking into a death trap of my own design. That wasn't far from the truth, because amid all the stress, I forgot both my business cards and my iMac's power cord...which, you can imagine, led to a ridiculously awkward and dismal night.</p><p><i><b>Lesson #4, Come prepared (or not at all):</b></i><i> Do not present half-baked work. If you're feeling unconfident, explain to your client that the deliverable isn't quite ready and you would like to reschedule so as not to waste their time.</i></p><p>The days after were even more contentious. Having lost any remaining shred of trust in me, my client set up a conference call with her previous developer—who proceeded to tear down my pricing and process.</p><p>To be fair, he was brought in with zero understanding of what had been built (though, he did make plenty of valid critiques, which I've captured here). But the humiliation of being lectured to by someone who had done the previous website for free and hadn't even bothered to maintain it stung more than anything I can remember.</p><p><i><b>Lesson #5, Trust Matters:</b></i><i> You cannot work without trust. If you come to feel that you have completely lost a client's trust, you need to end the project and issue a refund (as necessary), because it's simply not something you can rebuild.</i></p><h3>Making things right</h3><p>By this point, I was willing to do anything to make a clean break—I didn't even care about the hundreds of hours I had wasted on the project.</p><p>I suggested to my client that we take the existing content and move it to Squarespace, where she could easily manage the site herself (minus the higher-quality design and custom features). I vividly remember my client agreeing, while simultaneously remarking, \"I just needed something simple!\"</p><p>I silently shook my head in disbelief, thinking how ironic that sounded considering everything we had been through. In retrospect, though, I realized she was right. Everyone <i>wants</i> a Ferrari—they may even talk as if the <i>need</i> one, but few people really do.</p><p>Similarly, clients often hire you because they <i>want</i> something. <b>But it's your job to figure out what they really </b><b><i>need</i></b>. And if you can't tell the difference between the two, you have to keep asking questions until you can.</p><p><i><b>Lesson #6, Ask Lots of Good Questions:</b></i><i> Not knowing what you or your client doesn't know is a dangerous state to be in. If you feel uncertain (or if you feel TOO certain), stay in the diagnostic phase as long as you can. You'll thank yourself later.</i></p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>So there it is. My pro bono project-from hell. To date, it's been my worst experience as a freelancer, but also the experience that taught me the most.</p><p>Have a nightmare project of your own?

Store","slug":"learned-sales-working-running-store","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"5","month":"September","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"September 5, 2018","audience":"Everyone","category":"Business","tags":["freelance","running store","sales","part-time job"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<p>Three years into my freelance web design career I started working at a local running store to make some extra cash on the side.</p><p><b>But it wasn’t just that.</b> I also needed a break from staring at a computer all day and wanted to meet more people than I normally would as a stay-at-home freelancer (in other words…zero people).</p><p>That said, I didn’t expect to learn much from a job that paid $10/hr when I was earning more than six times that as a web developer.</p><p>I was so wrong.</p><h2>Lesson 1: Ask and You Shall Receive</h2><p>Frequently, customers will come into a running store and say something like, “<i>My knees hurt. I need a shoe with a lot of </i><i><b>cushion</b></i><i>!</i>”</p><p>A less-experienced me might answer “ok, I’ll grab a few <b>high-cushion</b> shoes…what size do you usually wear?” But this isn’t enough information to base a solid recommendation on.</p><p>In fact, within a few weeks of being hired I started to learn that the more questions I asked the happier my customers were with the shoes I brought out for them (and the more likely they were to buy them).</p><p>For example: Asking, “How long have you been wearing those?” often reveals that a customer has simply been running too long in the same shoes, and they don’t need more cushion—just a fresh pair!</p><h2>Lesson 2: Consider Everything, Trust Nothing</h2><p>People are notoriously unreliable witnesses, even (sometimes especially) when it comes to understanding or articulating their own needs.</p><p>I once worked with a guy who insisted he was a <b>size 9.5 wide</b>. In fact, not only did he measure as a 11 normal width, but the shoes he wore into the store were clearly marked with the larger size.</p><p>Whether you’re selling $120 sneakers or a $5,000 website, listening is an important skill, but you should <b>always verify</b> what your customers state as “fact.”</p><p>If you don’t catch misinformation early you can complete a whole project on inaccurate specs…and guess who’s going to get the blame?</p><p>*Hint: not the customer!</p><h2>Lesson 3: Sell Before You Sell</h2><p>The running store I work at has been around for more than 30 years. Most of their business comes from referrals and repeat customers.</p><p>As a salesman, this <b>makes my life easy</b> because most of the people who walk through the door are pre-sold—meaning they know what to expect (what our shoes cost, which brands we carry, etc).</p><p>Freelancers can also use this concept to their advantage:</p><ul><li><p>Post <b>price lists or ranges</b> on your website. This is the best way to discourage clients with insufficient budgets!</p></li><li><p>Give existing clients a PDF with info on your services and train them on how to make <b>quality referrals</b> (who your target audience is, etc).</p></li><li><p>Do one thing or package multiple services simply. I handle web design, development, and copywriting work, but I only offer <b>one final product</b>: custom small business websites.</p></li></ul><h2>Lesson 4: Have a Consistent Sales Process</h2><p>Sales is almost a dirty word in the freelance community. Personally, I still don’t 100% enjoy it—I’d rather be designing or writing code. BUT… selling shoes for hours at a time on a weekly basis has taught me that it can be much more rewarding if I simply incorporate a <b>clear sales process</b>.</p><p>My process for selling shoes looks something like this—notice how a few simple questions can narrow 500 shoes down to 20, making the task more manageable (and increasing the probability of success):</p><ol><li><p>Customer walks in and says they want new shoes: <b>500 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>I ask if they want the same thing or to start fresh: <b>Something similar</b></p></li><li><p>I ask what they would change about the shoe: <b>Too wide</b></p></li><li><p>We measure, and their current shoes ARE too wide: <b>20 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>I bring out three options. They like the second one: <b>5 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>I bring out two more like that. More testing: <b>3 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>They eliminate shoe 1, then test 2 and 3 some more: <b>2 Shoes</b></p></li><li><p>Shoe 3 wins!</p></li></ol><p>Your process should feel like an <b>“</b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_%28computer_programming%29\"><b>if/else” tree</b></a>. You start with a blank slate, not knowing what your prospective client wants or needs. Then, you ask a series of questions that narrow the possibilities down—a “<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/296526\">sales funnel</a>.”</p><p>Each intersection should be planned, like a railroad switch, and you should know what to do or which questions to ask next based on the answer your client gives. This eliminates the fear of uncertainty and makes you more confident in your recommendations!</p><h2>Lesson 5: Control the Sale</h2><p>As a freelancer, it can be very easy for a sale (or any project) to <b>“get away from you”</b> when you’re working with an inexperienced or impulsive client.</p><p>Similarly, I often have people come into my local running store who just start pulling random shoes off the wall: “I want this, and this, and that too!”</p><p>I saved this lesson for last because it’s the most important:</p><p><b>NEVER EVER</b> let your client hijack your sales process.</p><p>If you recognize this happening you need to bring things to a dead stop and restart from wherever you left off in your process. For example, to an unruly shoe customer, I’ll often say something like:</p><blockquote><p>“Ok, but before I grab those for you, let’s just double-check your shoe size.

It took three months of nonstop work. These days I build higher-quality, more complex sites in around 40 hours.</p><p>My secret? I learned to be lazy.</p><p>Now, don’t take that the wrong way. I’m working harder than I ever have, but my productivity as a developer has increased exponentially over time because I implemented a zero-tolerance policy for wastefulness.</p><p>In code speak, everything I do now is as “DRY” as possible.</p><h2>What’s DRY?</h2><p>I built many of my early sites using pre-made WordPress themes — and although they looked great initially, I quickly discovered how much redundant work was required to “hack” them into a format that fit my clients’ specific needs.</p><p>It’s not so bad adding a hundred food menu items until you realize that the layout of these menu items needs to change — and you have to go back and manually edit every… single… one.</p><p>This is both financially and mentally untenable for clients and developers, which is why I follow the DRY mantra…</p><p>aka: “Don’t Repeat Yourself.”</p><h2>A Very DRY Example</h2><p>Custom-coded websites provide excellent opportunities for implementing DRY processes. For example, instead of trying to update 100 menu items, I can create one template that accepts the minimal amount of information from each item (title, price, description).</p><p>In the backend of the website, my clients can simply fill out this info and it gets rendered by the template in a consistent, visually appealing format.</p><p>If my client asks me to alter the appearance of these menu items, I can make the change once in the template — and voila — it will take effect throughout the entire site, everywhere they display.</p><h2>Where DRY and Lazy Meet</h2><p>I think “laziness” gets a bad rap because it’s associated with present-tense laxness — i.e. “I don’t want to do the dishes right now.”</p><p>But to keep moving forward as a developer (or as any professional, really) it’s essential to have a lazy attitude toward the future.</p><p>Take Molly, for example, a fictional kid in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sygqZWBcuKk\">GE’s Inventing commercial</a> who really doesn’t want to take out the trash.</p><p>Once is enough, it turns out. She decides her brainpower can be put to better use and creates a pulley line to handle the job for her… which leads to more inventions and eventually a job at GE.</p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>It’s weird to say, but I think laziness is probably one of the most important drivers of innovation in the world.</p><p>Like Molly, most web developers (and people, in general) don’t want to get stuck doing menial, repetitive tasks.</p><p>We’re all lazy—in the best way possible—and that aversion toward monotony is what motivates us to keep creating brilliant, creative solutions to challenges. Because even the smallest amount of extra effort <i>now</i> can pay off a hundred fold down the road.</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Lazy dog on carpet","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5009380863039399,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=750&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=188&h=125&q=50 188w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=375&h=250&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=750&h=500&q=50 750w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=1125&h=750&q=50 1125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=1500&h=999&q=50 1500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/4CcjbfwwuQkMO8YgIokyKc/842f8ae885c28fe9089900796eb26b77/lazy-dog-carpet.jpg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}}},{"node":{"id":"380ebe1c-e74a-555b-8998-b14bef325467","title":"DIY or Hire an Expert: 5 Questions to Help You Decide","slug":"diy-or-hire-expert-questions","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"4","month":"July","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"July 4, 2018","audience":"Clients","category":"Business","tags":["DIY","expert"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<h2>One Step Forward, One Step Back.</h2><p>Our early ancestors weren’t astronauts or physicists or doctors.

Sure, but I hate doing it, and the definition of a “Marginal Tax Rate” is literally the last thing on earth I want taking up space in my brain.</p><p>My account loves that stuff. I’ll leave it to him.</p><h3>2: Do I know what is required?</h3><p>A few times a year I rotate and/or swap my snow and summer tires. It’s a relatively simple task, and requires only a few tools (jack, tire iron, lubricant).</p><p>On the other hand, I would never try to replace my car’s brakes because I don’t know — even generally — what parts or processes are involved.</p><p>If you can’t outline the basic skills and steps the project requires, then you should go ahead and hire someone who does.</p><h3>3: Is DIY a good use of my time?</h3><p>There’s a common misconception that DIY is somehow “cheap” or even “free.” It’s true, technically you’re not paying someone when you handle a job yourself, but what is your own time worth?</p><p>I could save $25/mo by having clients mail me checks, but <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/\">FreshBooks</a> takes care of this automatically, which frees up multiple hours in my schedule.</p><p>I can use this time to learn new skills, find new clients, or take time off — all of which pay back the original cost manyfold.</p><h3>4: Will the final product be high-quality?</h3><p>Once upon a time (aka two years ago) I tried to code my own project management app. It was a fun and super-rewarding experience, but the task was way too much for one person to handle.</p><p>Nowadays, I <a href=\"http://sherpadesign.co/notebook/activecollab-plan-manage-complex-projects/\">manage complex projects</a> with ActiveCollab, and I’m amazed, on a daily basis, at how much thought and effort must have gone into the app to make it powerful, yet simple and user friendly.</p><p>If you’re starting a DIY project as a beginner, it’s unrealistic to expect professional results.</p><h3>5: Do I know what success and failure look like (specifically)?</h3><p>One of the most challenging parts of learning a new process or skill is trying to figure out whether you’ve done things the right way or made costly mistakes.</p><p>In other words, <i>it’s hard to know what you don’t know</i>.</p><p>Let’s say you create a website on Squarespace. It seems to look ok, so you go ahead and launch. Months go by, and you aren’t getting any traction.</p><p>An expert might review your site and find that your contact form is broken, or your design doesn’t work well on mobile devices, or one of a million such details that they’re trained to be aware of.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>DIY is a great option for casual, low-stakes projects, but can quickly turn into a rabbit hole for more complex undertakings.</p><p>If you answered “no” to more than one of these questions, you should take a step back and consider whether hiring an expert might be the smarter option.</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Stuck in washing machine","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5009380863039399,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=750&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=188&h=125&q=50 188w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=375&h=250&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=750&h=500&q=50 750w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1125&h=750&q=50 1125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1500&h=999&q=50 1500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/6o1gLMrgvCG6wWM8Qo806M/dfda96e246a5bd29d0a0dee50ab04d47/stuck-in-washing-machine.jpeg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}}},{"node":{"id":"63b98bf7-1016-5b6d-b83e-0372cdf08932","title":"5 Stages of Being a WordPress Developer (#4 is Moving On)","slug":"stages-being-wordpress-developer","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"6","month":"June","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"June 6, 2018","audience":"Freelancers","category":"Web Development","tags":["WordPress","web developer","static websites"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<h2>Part 1: How I Discovered WordPress</h2><p>I “built” my first WordPress website in the summer of 2014—like a lot of newbie developers I didn’t have much skill with coding, so I started out with a <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/item/lemonchili-a-restaurant-wordpress-theme/4565068\">pre-made theme</a> and proceeded to hack it into a semi-serviceable state.</p><p><i>This is brilliant</i>, I thought.</p><p>For $40, you could buy a website, and (like magic) just add content. When my clients needed new features, I could simply install a plugin. Easy.</p><h3>Not so fast, sparky…</h3><p>As it turns out, this was a <i>massive</i> over-simplification of what it took to create an effective website. After using pre-made themes for my first four or five projects, the limitations began to become <i>painfully clear</i>.</p><p>I was spending the vast majority of my time contacting support and doggedly searching StackOverflow, rather than actually building or designing.</p><p>Too often, when my clients requested a certain layout change or feature addition, I had to either tell them that it couldn’t be done or add YET ANOTHER plugin, making their sites more and more unstable.</p><h3>Copy-and-paste hell</h3><p>Worse, most themes offered no way to reuse content. And while copy-and-pasting worked well initially, it became a nightmare when content changes meant editing 50 different theme options to change one color.</p><p>I didn’t know it at the time, but I was treading all over the principal rule of web development: DRY, aka “Don’t Repeat Yourself.”</p><p>Even though I generally _liked _WordPress, this wasn’t sustainable.</p><h2>Part 2: Coding Custom Themes</h2><p><i>Ahh</i>, I thought. <i>I know what the problem is…I just need to make MY OWN themes from scratch, instead of using pre-made templates.</i></p><p>By this point, I had already left a full-time job as a copywriter to start my own web design business, so I had an abundance of free time on my hands—it was the perfect time to learn how to code.</p><h3>My first WordPress theme</h3><p>After spending two months getting the basics down, I took on my first <i>truly custom</i> website project. Not surprisingly, it was MUCH more difficult than I expected, and I was <b>up for 36+ hours the night before launch</b>, tearing my hair out over a seemingly endless list of problems.</p><p>BUT…despite the extra work, coding websites was definitely more rewarding than hacking pre-made themes—it produced a higher-quality end product that I was actually <i>proud</i> of. Things were looking up.</p><h3>“Don’t Repeat Yourself” revisited</h3><p>While I was much more able to implement a DRY workflow coding websites from scratch, I was still repeating myself from <i>project-to-project</i>.</p><p>In mid 2015, I started writing a plugin, “WP Blueprint,” to normalize WordPress and make certain tasks easier—creating common fields, implementing a blog, adding a mobile menu, etc.</p><p>It wasn’t easy, but I eventually got to a point where I could build WordPress themes relatively quickly with less initial hassle.</p><p>Still, there was another problem looming…</p><h2>Part 3: Swamped By Maintenance</h2><p>Hosting and maintenance were sticking points for many of my clients. They were frustrated by having to pay a monthly fee <i>on top of</i> the sizable investment they had already made.</p><p>And while I was finally enjoying the process of building websites, I also hated being tied down by longterm maintenance—it was preventing me from getting a sense of satisfaction from finishing projects.</p><h3>Where there’s a fee, there’s a way…or not</h3><p>At first, I charged $10/mo, then $20, then $35, and finally $75 in an attempt to make maintaining WordPress sites _worth it _for me.</p><p>The trouble is, WordPress sites need to receive frequent updates, and a single line of bad or incompatible code can take your entire site down—or worse, leave it vulnerable to hackers (who can smell <i>insecure WordPress sites</i> like <i>sharks can smell blood in the water</i>).</p><p>Not to mention, all this stress felt like a ridiculous waste of my time and of my clients’ money. Something had to change.</p><h2>Part 4: Taking My Sanity Back</h2><p>I’ve been hearing the term “<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/denji/7205625\">static site generator</a>” for years, but it was my frustration with WordPress that finally caused me to investigate deeper.</p><p>Simply put…</p><blockquote><p>A static site generator (SSG) is a tool that takes some raw data (say, a bunch of text files or a JSON response from an API) and compiles that data into a nice, neat package that can be served anywhere.</p></blockquote><p>Given the lower cost, better performance, and easier development process, I was intrigued—and after knocking out a simple project in <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby.js</a> (one of many SSGs available), I was 100% sold.</p><p>I’ve since built one app and three more static websites.</p><h3>Goodbye PHP. Hello Node.js!</h3><p>PHP will always have a special place in my heart—it’s a great language, and it’s also how (via WordPress) I first learned a lot of core coding concepts, like object-oriented programming and inheritance.</p><p>But it’s also stale, over-stuffed with antiquated, inconsistent features, and incapable of handling real-time user interaction.</p><p>With Node.js (and Javascript), I no longer have to worry about separating my code into two languages, and the clear dominance of Javascript over PHP offers a wider horizon of future possibilities.</p><h3>What maintenance?</h3><p>Like I mentioned earlier, WordPress sites are <i>notoriously difficult to maintain</i>. Static sites, on the other hand, require little to no maintenance, and (barring feature additions or redesigns) can be left to their own devices for years.</p><p>Because content for static sites is either stored as raw files or requested from a highly secure content management system (CMS), like <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a> or <a href=\"https://prismic.io/\">Prismic</a>, the chances of getting hacked are <i>significantly</i> lower than they would be for your average WordPress install.</p><p>Netlify won’t deploy a build with errors. #PeaceOfMind ✌️</p><p>Plus, when clients do make content changes, a static site host, like <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>, will attempt to rebuild your app. If there are errors, the changes will <i>not</i> go live—as opposed to WordPress errors, which can instantly take down your whole site.</p><p>This is an <i>absolute godsend</i> for busy developers and non-tech-savvy clients.</p><h2>Part 5: Will I Ever Go Back to WordPress?</h2><p>Probably not… 😢 While WordPress may appeal to entry-level audiences for years to come, I see nothing on the horizon that will make the platform attractive to developers.</p><h3>Gutenberg won’t save WordPress</h3><p>As of version 5.0, WordPress will be switching over to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>—its shiny new visual editor—in an attempt to fend off competition from website builder platforms like Wix and Squarespace.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I think Gutenberg is a potentially great addition for users on a limited budget, but for developers…</p><blockquote><p>…it works about as well as a mechanic handing their customer a toolbox and saying, “Have at it, hoss!”</p></blockquote><p>A much better solution is for developers to provide users with explicit inputs for their information and content—which can then be used to deliver a high-quality, well-thought-out front-end.</p><h3>Problems run deep</h3><p>WordPress has been a hot mess for years — the tens of thousands of plugins in existence are less a testament to the flexibility of WordPress than they are an attempt to relentlessly shoehorn a <b>blogging platform</b> into roles it was never intended or built to fill.</p><p>Even if the REST API was production-ready (which it’s really not), it’s mostly pointless, because the vast majority of plugins that make WordPress a desirable solution don’t work with headless, API-driven apps.</p><p>At the end of the day,

Businesses","slug":"static-websites-small-businesses","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"17","month":"May","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"May 17, 2018","audience":"Everyone","category":"Web Development","tags":["Pingdom","speed test","load time","static websites","Netlify","headless CMS","Contentful"],"content":{"childContentfulRichText":{"html":"<h2>What’s a “dynamic” website?</h2><p>When you visit a page on a dynamic website (like WordPress), a request is made to a database, which returns some data. That data is then used to build an HTML page. Pretty cool!</p><p>The downside is, most small business websites don’t change on an <i>hourly</i> or even <i>daily</i> basis, so the same pages are being “dynamically” built over and over for no reason.</p><h2>What’s a “static” website?</h2><p>In contrast, static sites build every possible page of your website <i>ahead of time</i> and serve them as a package that can be hosted for little to no cost, virtually anywhere.</p><p>They’re faster, more secure, and require less maitenance than dynamics sites, which—for small business owners—means happy users and zero stress.</p><p>Let’s dive into the top five reasons a static site might be the perfect fit for your next project!</p><h3>1. Security</h3><p>Here’s a scary fact: according to WP White Security, “70% of all WordPress installs are <a href=\"https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-news-updates/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/\">vulnerable to hacker attacks</a>.”</p><p>Unlike dynamic websites, static website do not have databases. In other words, they either contain plain HTML files or receive data ahead of time from a seperate, highly-secure source.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Peace of mind. Once set up, a static website can fend for itself, and is essentially impossible to hack.</p><h3>2. Low-Maintenance</h3><p>Traditional content management platforms require constant updates to remain secure, as well as maintenance to ensure these updates don’t break existing functionality.</p><p>Static sites can fetch data from modern “<a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/blog/2018/05/02/how-i-fell-in-love-with-an-api-first-cms/\">API-driven</a>” services (like <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>) that require <i>no maintenance</i> and can be deployed for free.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> No headaches. Your website will work just as well tomorrow as it will five years from now.</p><h3>3. Speed</h3><p>40% of people will leave a site that takes <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/\">longer than three seconds</a> to load.</p><p>That’s a tall order for many dynamic sites—they’re often Frankenstein’ed together with a hideous array of software and hardware that drags down performance.</p><p>Static websites, on the other hand, are highly-optimized, and generally load 10x faster than dynamic sites. Below is a speed test of this page! You can test your site at <a href=\"https://tools.pingdom.com/\">Pingdom</a>.</p><img class='contentful-embedded-asset' src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/hkvY7EUULYqGuqWWgYOAa/a9e5e9f967ada345f08730d8263d2709/sherpa-blog-speed-test.jpg\"/><p></p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Happy users! People are busy—when you respect a potential customer’s time, they’ll be more likely to connect with you, instead of leaving and Googling a competitor.</p><h3>4. Cost-Effective</h3><p>Dynamic websites are complex, which makes them expensive to host and maintain.</p><p>Like I mentioned before, static sites are little more than a package of flat HTML files, which makes hosting much simpler and less expensive.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Cha-ching! Plenty of static hosts (like <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>) and even modern CMS companies offer allow you to deploy a static website for free!</p><h3>5. Flexibility</h3><p>Gone are the days when small businesses had too be tied to one specific platform or technology.</p><p>Static websites are “<a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/headless-and-decoupled-cms/\">headless</a>,” which means you can easily change your front end with minimal edits to the back end (content management)—and vice versa.</p><p><b>The Benefit:</b> Freedom! If you don’t like some aspect of your website, you won’t have to feel like a prisoner to the current setup.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>While static sites won’t fit <i>every</i> use-case (like large blogs or complex e-commerce stores), it’s a really exciting option for most small businesses.</p><p>Feel free to get in touch, and we can assess whether a static website might be a effective option for your next project.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p>—Andrew</p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Man working at laptop

Projects","slug":"activecollab-manage-complex-projects","__typename":"ContentfulJournalEntry","dayNumber":"11","month":"May","year":"2018","fullPublishDate":"May 11,

Project management is the ugly duckling of freelance.</h2><p>It can be extremely difficult, time-consuming, and boring. But, quite frankly, I think the tools — <i>not</i> the process itself — are at fault.</p><p>When I started freelancing, I was using a combination of Microsoft Word documents, emails, and my brain to keep track of everything, which (spoiler alert) was a nightmare, not a viable project management system.</p><p>I knew project management apps were an option, but the cost (i.e. <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/pricing\">Basecamp</a>) and overall clunkiness (<a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/projects\">Zoho</a>, etc) kept me from using them for a long time.</p><h3>ActiveCollab to the Rescue!</h3><p>I subscribed to <a href=\"https://activecollab.com/\">ActiveCollab</a> in the middle of a large website project that had become too much to manage via email and static notes.</p><p>The company promises a “Powerful, yet simple project management tool,” and that’s exactly what you get.</p><p>The interface is clean and modern, and it was, indeed, so simple to use that I got up-and-running in a matter of minutes.</p><h3>A Few Features I love</h3><p>My favorite thing about ActiveCollab is that the app seems to “anticipate” what I need — whenever I find myself wanting a new feature, the first thing I try often works exactly as I expect.</p><p><b>Multiple Platforms:</b> ActiveCollab can be downloaded for iPhone, accessed in the browser, or installed on your Mac (the desktop app is still a beta version, but performs marvelously).</p><p><b>Sortable Projects:</b> It’s easy to create projects and assign them to a new or existing client. The various filters (client, category, etc) give me a quick bird’s eye view of everything I’m working on.</p><p><b>Tasks and Lists:</b> Lists within a given project keep things organized, and you can add helpful details to individual tasks (like due dates, file attachments, and assigned team members).</p><p><b>Pricing:</b> $25/mo is very reasonable!</p><h3>My Process For Building Websites</h3><ol><li><p><b>Preparation:</b> My first step is always to conduct an in-depth information gathering session with my client to discuss their primary challenges, and then define an effective solution.</p></li><li><p><b>Setup:</b> Next, I create a new ActiveCollab project from a pre-existing template to map out some high-level milestones, such as “Home Page Mockup Review,” “Testing,” and “Website Launch.”</p></li><li><p><b>Notes:</b> Whenever I have a call or receive input from a client, I take notes directly in ActiveCollab and parse out todo items into individual tasks, which ensures we don’t lose track of anything we discussed.</p></li><li><p><b>Accountability:</b> I assign all tasks to a team member, add due dates, and attach files, so everything can be managed from one location… no more scouring my inbox for elusive emails!</p></li><li><p><b>Debrief:</b> Once a project is finished, I check back on a task list called “Project Debrief,” which I use along the way to capture any mistakes or ideas for future improvement.</p></li><li><p><b>Implementation:</b> These get moved into specific templates or projects under my own company page (so I remember to implement them in my next project).</p></li></ol><p></p>"}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Journal / Managing Complex Projects with ActiveCollab","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.78173719376392,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=750&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=188&h=106&q=50 188w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=375&h=210&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=750&h=421&q=50 750w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=1125&h=631&q=50 1125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=1500&h=842&q=50 1500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rupfy7kogibm/5uwpa2oSkgMq2W4AkKCaGQ/68974c5e307c004ac05ffa1fd16842d1/complex-highway.jpeg?w=1600&h=898&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"journal"}}
